This repository contains an implementation of a RV32I fetch pipeline microprocessor. The RV32I is a 32-bit RISC-V instruction set architecture, with the 'I' extension indicating the base integer instructions.

## Overview

The RV32I fetch pipeline microprocessor is designed to efficiently fetch and execute RV32I instructions. It consists of several stages including instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write back. Each stage is optimized for performance and minimal latency.

## Features

- RV32I instruction set support
- Pipelined architecture for improved throughput
- Efficient instruction fetch mechanism
- Modular design for easy expansion and customization
